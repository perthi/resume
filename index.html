      <p>
        My name is Per Thomas Hille. I have a PhD in instrumentation for nuclear physics from CERN and a master’s degree in electronics from the University of Oslo. I have also worked as a researcher at Yale. I have extensive experience with the development and verification of SW projects and embedded systems both as a developer and as a Tech-Lead, Scrum Master, and project manager.
        My core technical skills are C ++, embedded Linux and microcontroller programming on STM32 with FreeRTOS. I also have experience in several other areas.
        In the last couple of years, I have taken a great interest in everything related to Data Science and Machine Learning, especially artificial intelligence, and have updated myself a professionally in this field.
        I was security cleared at level "SECRET" and "NATO SECRET" in February 2021.
