          KONGSBERG NORSPACE     09.2015 – 04.2019 <br>

          Role: Technical Project Lead, Developer, SCRUM Master <br>
          Description: I was project manager for the development of a test system for the product line at Kongsberg Norspace, which produces equipment for satellite communication. These products are mostly tailor-made. The system must support a wide range of products with many configurable options based on customer specification. A special challenge in this system is to find the balance between complexity and user friendliness for the user of the system, which in many contexts are conflicting requirements. <br><br>

           With a small project team of 4-6 people, it was natural that I also had technical tasks. I was the administrator of the entire server infrastructure for continuous regression, and unit testing as well as source code control and agile development. I was responsible for streamlining the building system for software that consists of over 100 subprojects / modules.
           Of purely programming tasks, I was responsible for implementing drivers, the state machine for the system, logging, exception handling and various due tasks. <br><br>

          PRESENS 								 02.2014 – 05.2015 <br>
          Role: Principal developer, Project Manager <br>
          Description: PRESENS is the market leader in pressure sensors for the oil industry. I was responsible for developing a computer model for pressure and temperature response to a silicon-based pressure sensor. The model was implemented in C++ and has one user interface in LabVIEW and one CLI for Linux. The model is used to calibrate the sensor by loading parameters generated by the model into the sensor and used while to accurately reproduce pressure and temperature on-line with a microcontroller mounted on the sensor. The first part of the job was to improve existing software to automate the entire process of calibration as well as generate test reports in PDF. In phase 2, other types of models were looked at to parameterize the calibration results to improve the accuracy of the sensor, including the use of splines, as well as optimization of the existing model. This work resulted in an improvement in the accuracy of the sensor of about 20%. <br>
          Technology/Methodology: C++, LabVIEW, Linear Algebra <br>
         </p>
         <p> 
         DATA RESPONS							     	        04.2013 – 12.2013 <br>
          Role: Senior developer, Sales <br>
          Description: In periods where I have not been on assignment with customers, I have participated in planning and estimation in connection with sales of new projects. I have implemented a common framework (C ++) for regression testing and continuous integration against different HW platforms from a centralized building Server. The framework has one API against JENKINS on the one hand and one Interface over TCP / IP with password less SSH against various embedded Linux systems on the other side. I have also been responsible for maintenance and support of software developed by Data Respons for existing customers made by developers who have left the company.
         </p>

          VESTAS/OCAS								        11.2012 – 04.2013 <br>
          Role: Project Manager, senior developer, planning and sales.<br>
          Description: The Obstacle Collision Avoidance System (OCAS) is a radar warning system for wind farms. The task consisted of creating a re-spin of existing HW, among other things to replace end of life components and to simplify the HW platform by combining the functionality of several separate circuit boards on one circuit board. The system is based on a custom Linux distribution created with Yocto. My task consisted of initial planning and sales, as well as project management in the first phase of the project. I was also responsible for infrastructure for continuous regression and regression testing.<br>

          Technology/Methodology: Agile/SCRUM, Confluence, JIRA, Linux(uClinux), Barebox, C, C++
         </p>
         <p>
           Det Norske Veritas (later HalfWave)				        08.2011 – 09.2012 <br>
           Role: Project Manager, senior developer <br>
          
           Description: ART-GPS (Acoustic Resonance Technology Gas Pipe Scanner) is a verification tool for gas pipelines. The technology is revolutionary in that the quality of gas pipelines can be verified without stopping production. This places special demands on the Embedded platform regarding temperature, vibration, and power consumption because the scanner operates autonomously in the gas lines and is driven by the gas pressure. <br>

            My task in the project consisted of two phases. The first phase of the project I led the work write a report on the existing HW / SW platform as well as estimation of the remaining work after the previous subcontractor had failed.<br>

            This work resulted in a phase 2 of the project, where my employer, Data Respons, was hired to implement the remaining work. I was project manager for a team that consisted of 5-12 developers who implemented FW and SW for the data collection system. Systems were based on two different Embedded Linux platforms. <br>
            
            In addition to the role as project manager, I also worked as a developer in periods where the project was scaled down in anticipation of investors and there was therefore no need for me to work full time as a project manager.
            Then I was responsible for infrastructure for continuous integration and regression testing (Jenkins, JIRA, FishEye). I also implemented a test framework in C ++ for platform verification. <br>

            The project concluded with a successful pipe scan from Kårstø to Statfjord B in October 2012 and was one of the largest projects for Data Respons in 2012. The product is currently in full operation.<br>

            The HW platform was based on Embedded Linux with two different Linux platforms.
            • A supervisory system with uClinux on a Blackfin processor.
            • A data collection module based on a Linux distribution from Freescale (NXP) and IMX.6
            They made project-specific modifications to both embedded Linux solutions on root file system, kernel, bootloader + some modifications of existing drivers. Many of these modifications were made by me. <br>

            Role: Researcher, shift leader, Developer. <br>
            Description: I was involved in computer simulations (C ++) and analysis of experimental data for the "EMCAL Physics Performance Report" which was an important document in the work of obtaining funding for the project. Among other sources from the US Department of Energy. The simulation work used GRID computing against data centers in Livermore (US), Catania and CERN, among others, consisting of non-homogeneous PC farmers running various distributions of Linux. I had the main responsibility for evaluating different methods for analysis of raw data. I also worked with the setup and installation of experimental equipment and analysis of calibration data from three of the accelerator complexes at CERN; Proton Synchrotron (PS), Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). By combining test data from these 3 different accelerator systems, I managed to improve the calibration of EMCAL by 12%.
         
            In addition, I have also worked both as a shift leader and crew on the ALICE experiment at the LHC during the initial tests of the detector and LHC accelerator complex in 2011.

          Role: Researcher, software coordinator <br>
          Description: I worked on the implementation of analysis software for ALICE High Level Trigger (HLT) at CERN. HLT is a PC farm consisting of about 2000 PCs with dual quad core AMD processors connected with an InfiniBand back-bone and with Ubuntu Linux as operating system. The system analyzes on-line data that is read in via about 500 optical links from the experiment with a data rate of up to 100 GB / s. <br>
          
          My tasks consisted of creating computer programs for simulations (C ++ with a user interface in LabVIEW for configuration of simulation parameters), as well as analysis and compression algorithms (C ++) to achieve a maximum storage rate of 1.25 GB / s. This is very performance-critical software that requires a lot of optimization. Part of the work consisted of developing a novel method for estimating signal parameters from over sampled detector signals that allows near optimal estimation 120-1000 faster than traditional methods. The method was first justified theoretically and then implemented in C ++. The method is currently part of the standard analysis software at CERN. The subproject consisted of 3-5 developers, while the HLT project involves about 80 developers and engineers. <br>
