        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>My name is Per Thomas Hille. I am a tech freak and is interested in anything related to technology.
          Outside my professional endeavors I am passionate about music and sports. I play classical piano, and Im a big fan of
          cycling and formula 1 as well as many other sports.
          
          On the professional level I have a PhD in instrumentation for nuclear physics from CERN and a master’s degree in electronics from the University of Oslo. I have also worked as a researcher at Yale. I have extensive experience with the development and verification of SW projects and embedded systems both as a developer and as a Tech-Lead, Scrum Master, and project manager.
          My core technical skills are C ++, embedded Linux and microcontroller programming on STM32 with FreeRTOS. I also have experience in several other areas.
          In the last couple of years, I have taken a great interest in everything related to Data Science and Machine Learning, especially artificial intelligence, and have updated myself a professionally in this field.
          I was security cleared at level "SECRET" and "NATO SECRET" in February 2021.

This is a cloud solution where updating SW is done within a DevOps regime. I am responsible for developing a custom Linux distribution based on Yocto / Poky. This will run various applications using Docker containers that are updated from a separate cloud service. I am also responsible for quality assurance of existing SW solutions by introducing unit testing, regression testing and continuous integration. This code is written in C ++. Furthermore, I have implemented FW for several STM32 micro controllers that communicate with an embedded Linux over CAN bus as well as ISOTP-CAN with protobuf as protocol on top of as ISOTP-CAN. I have also written bootloaders for the same microcontrollers.<br>
