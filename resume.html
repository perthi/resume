        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>My name is Per Thomas Hille. I am a tech freak and is interested in
          anything related to technology. <br><br>
          Outside my professional endeavors I am passionate about music and
          sports. I play classical piano, and Im a big fan of
          cycling and formula 1 as well as many other sports.

          On the professional level I have a PhD in instrumentation for nuclear
          physics from CERN and a master’s degree in electronics from the
          University of Oslo. I have also worked as a researcher at Yale. I have
          extensive experience with the development and verification of SW
          projects and embedded systems both as a developer and as a Tech-Lead,
          Scrum Master, and project manager.
          My core technical skills are C ++, embedded Linux and microcontroller
          programming on STM32 with FreeRTOS. I also have experience in several
          other areas.
          In the last couple of years, I have taken a great interest in
          everything related to Data Science and Machine Learning, especially
          artificial intelligence, and have updated myself a professionally in
          this field.
          I was security cleared at level "SECRET" and "NATO SECRET" in February
          2021.

            Description: R&D Project in control technology and motor control
            using
            Field Oriented Control (FOC). The project involves making an
            electro-mechanical winch with a very high efficiency. The winch is
            so
            compact that all electronics can fit inside the drum. With high
            voltages and high power at a small volume, this places very special
            demands on risk analysis, requirements handling and testing. The
            system also has very strict real-time requirements due to PWM
            frequencies that must operate outside the audible range.

            Description: Mama-k, BeamTech. The project aims at an improved
            method
            for the use of proton beams in cancer treatment. The system involves
            creating a control system that allows this to be done significantly
            more accurately than an existing solution, and thus to a greater
            extent avoid damaging healthy tissue.<br>

            My role was to summarize a "feasibility study" in which I assessed
            whether the proposed system is technically and practically possible
            from a physics point of view. In addition, I aided assistance in
            connection with two patent applications. <br>

            Role: Technical Project Lead, Developer, SCRUM Master <br>
            Description: I was project manager for the development of a test
            system for the product line at Kongsberg Norspace, which produces
            equipment for satellite communication. These products are mostly
            tailor-made. The system must support a wide range of products with
            many configurable options based on customer specification. A special
            challenge in this system is to find the balance between complexity
            and
            user friendliness for the user of the system, which in many contexts
            are conflicting requirements. <br><br>

            With a small project team of 4-6 people, it was natural that I also
            had technical tasks. I was the administrator of the entire server
            infrastructure for continuous regression, and unit testing as well
            as
            source code control and agile development. I was responsible for
            streamlining the building system for software that consists of over
            100 subprojects / modules.
            Of purely programming tasks, I was responsible for implementing
            drivers, the state machine for the system, logging, exception
            handling
            and various due tasks. <br><br>

            <p>
            Role: Principal developer, Project Manager <br>
            Description: PRESENS is the market leader in pressure sensors for
            the
            oil industry. I was responsible for developing a computer model for
            pressure and temperature response to a silicon-based pressure
            sensor.
            The model was implemented in C++ and has one user interface in
            LabVIEW
            and one CLI for Linux. The model is used to calibrate the sensor by
            loading parameters generated by the model into the sensor and used
            while to accurately reproduce pressure and temperature on-line with
            a
            microcontroller mounted on the sensor. The first part of the job was
            to improve existing software to automate the entire process of
            calibration as well as generate test reports in PDF. In phase 2,
            other
            types of models were looked at to parameterize the calibration
            results
            to improve the accuracy of the sensor, including the use of splines,
            as well as optimization of the existing model. This work resulted in
            an improvement in the accuracy of the sensor of about 20%. <br>

            Description: The Obstacle Collision Avoidance System (OCAS) is a
            radar
            warning system for wind farms. The task consisted of creating a
            re-spin of existing HW, among other things to replace end of life
            components and to simplify the HW platform by combining the
            functionality of several separate circuit boards on one circuit
            board.
            The system is based on a custom Linux distribution created with
            Yocto.
            My task consisted of initial planning and sales, as well as project
            management in the first phase of the project. I was also responsible
            for infrastructure for continuous regression and regression testing.<br>

            <p>
            Role: Project Manager, senior developer <br>
      
            Description: ART-GPS (Acoustic Resonance Technology Gas Pipe
            Scanner)
            is a verification tool for gas pipelines. The technology is
            revolutionary in that the quality of gas pipelines can be verified
            without stopping production. This places special demands on the
            Embedded platform regarding temperature, vibration, and power
            consumption because the scanner operates autonomously in the gas
            lines
            and is driven by the gas pressure. <br>

            My task in the project consisted of two phases. The first phase of
            the
            project I led the work write a report on the existing HW / SW
            platform
            as well as estimation of the remaining work after the previous
            subcontractor had failed.<br>

            This work resulted in a phase 2 of the project, where my employer,
            Data Respons, was hired to implement the remaining work. I was
            project
            manager for a team that consisted of 5-12 developers who implemented
            FW and SW for the data collection system. Systems were based on two
            different Embedded Linux platforms. <br>

            In addition to the role as project manager, I also worked as a
            developer in periods where the project was scaled down in
            anticipation
            of investors and there was therefore no need for me to work full
            time
            as a project manager.
            Then I was responsible for infrastructure for continuous integration
            and regression testing (Jenkins, JIRA, FishEye). I also implemented
            a
            test framework in C ++ for platform verification. <br>

            The project concluded with a successful pipe scan from Kårstø to
            Statfjord B in October 2012 and was one of the largest projects for
            Data Respons in 2012. The product is currently in full operation.<br>

            The HW platform was based on Embedded Linux with two different Linux
            platforms.
            • A supervisory system with uClinux on a Blackfin processor.
            • A data collection module based on a Linux distribution from
            Freescale (NXP) and IMX.6
            They made project-specific modifications to both embedded Linux
            solutions on root file system, kernel, bootloader + some
            modifications
            of existing drivers. Many of these modifications were made by me.

            <p>
            Role: Researcher, shift leader, Developer. <br>
            Description: I was involved in computer simulations (C ++) and
            analysis of experimental data for the
            "EMCAL Physics Performance Report" which was an important document
            in
            the work of obtaining funding for the project. Among other sources
            from the US Department of Energy. The simulation work used GRID
            computing against data centers in Livermore (US), Catania and CERN,
            among others, consisting of non-homogeneous PC farmers running
            various
            distributions of Linux. I had the main responsibility for evaluating
            different methods for analysis of raw data. I also worked with the
            setup and installation of experimental equipment and analysis of
            calibration data from three of the accelerator complexes at CERN;
            Proton Synchrotron (PS), Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and the
            Large
            Hadron Collider (LHC). By combining test data from these 3 different
            accelerator systems, I managed to improve the calibration of EMCAL
            by
            12%.

            In addition, I have also worked both as a shift leader and crew on
            the
            ALICE experiment at the LHC during the initial tests of the detector
            and LHC accelerator complex in 2011.
            Technology/Methodology: C/C++, GRID computing, Neural Networks,

            <p>
            Role: Researcher, Implementation of embedded Linux Software
            (ARM/uClinux) & analyses software, reporting to the US Department of
            Energy (DOE) <br>
            Description: I was responsible for calibrating one of the particle
            detectors, EMCAL, for the ALICE experiment at CERN with cosmic rays
            (muons). EMCAL is the electromagnetic calorimeter for the ALICE
            experiment (The Big Bang experiment). EMCAL measures high-energy
            gamma
            rays that are an important observable in Big Bang cosmology. It is
            common to calibrate such detectors with cosmic rays that hit the
            earth
            at a rate of about 100 / m2.sec. <br>

            My main responsibility was setting up experimental equipment and
            implementing software for detector control (embedded Linux) and data
            analysis (C / C ++) for filtering and analysis of relevant detector
            signals usable for calibration. My team consisted of three engineers
            and involved the supervision of 2 students who had different tasks
            on
            the project.<br>

            <p>
            Role: Researcher, software coordinator <br>
            Description: I worked on the implementation of analysis software for
            ALICE High Level Trigger (HLT) at CERN. HLT is a PC farm consisting
            of
            about 2000 PCs with dual quad core AMD processors connected with an
            InfiniBand back-bone and with Ubuntu Linux as operating system. The
            system analyzes on-line data that is read in via about 500 optical
            links from the experiment with a data rate of up to 100 GB / s. <br>

            My tasks consisted of creating computer programs for simulations (C
            ++
            with a user interface in LabVIEW for configuration of simulation
            parameters), as well as analysis and compression algorithms (C ++)
            to
            achieve a maximum storage rate of 1.25 GB / s. This is very
            performance-critical software that requires a lot of optimization.
            Part of the work consisted of developing a novel method for
            estimating
            signal parameters from over sampled detector signals that allows
            near
            optimal estimation 120-1000 faster than traditional methods. The
            method was first justified theoretically and then implemented in C
            ++.
            The method is currently part of the standard analysis software at
            CERN. The subproject consisted of 3-5 developers, while the HLT
            project involves about 80 developers and engineers. <br>
